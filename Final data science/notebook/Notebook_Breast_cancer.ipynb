    "* A partir de la evalucion de los modelos SVM lineal y no lineal concluimos que el problema es uno de clasificacion lineal, ya que se obtuvieron mejores resultados con un kernel lineal\n",
    "* Sin embargo, como se hipotetisó el modelo se equivoco mas en los casos negativos, se tuvo un recall de 93% para esta clase. Pero, cuando detectó un tumor maligno su tuvo una exactitud mayor que aquella en el benigno, es decir si un tumor se detecta como maligno es extremadamente probable que sea así.\n",
    "* Estos resultados mejoraran si se tienen mas datos, pero de momento se recomienda utilizar el modelo como descarte de malignidad en tumores, es decir, si se detecta que el tumor es maligno con un 98% de probabibilidad esto es verdad."
